# Google Homepage


For this mini-project, I deconstructed the Google homepage and rebuild it. 

Things I Learned:
* using flex was a big part for creating top-bottom order for the broader elements, as well as creating the type of spaing for 
    smaller sections like creating middle space for the navigation bars.
* inspecting the actual homepage was helpful for finding exact sizes, colors, etc. 
* you can filter through the css selector states in inspector
* how margins, paddings, and width/size affect an element differently, most notable when working with the buttons.
